# Cybersecurity-Before-Code-Learning-to-Think-Like-a-Defender
My interest in cybersecurity began after my social media accounts were hacked. The experience was frustrating and upsetting, mainly because I did not know how to respond, recover, or prevent it from happening again. During that time, I also connected with others who had experienced similar attacks. This made me realize how vulnerable everyday digital platforms are and how many people operate online without the knowledge needed to protect themselves. That moment sparked my decision to begin learning cybersecurity, starting from awareness and prevention.
Through my initial learning, I’ve begun to understand that many cyber incidents start with common digital habits, such as:
Clicking unknown or misleading links
Reusing passwords across multiple platforms
Weak account recovery settings
Oversharing personal information on social media
Using unsecured or public Wi-Fi networks
These actions often seem harmless but can expose accounts and personal data to attackers.
Threats Behind These Actions
Some of the key threats I am learning to recognize include:
Phishing: deceptive messages designed to steal login details
Account Takeover: unauthorized access due to compromised credentials
Social Engineering: manipulation of users into revealing sensitive information
Malware: malicious software that compromises devices and accounts
Understanding how these threats operate has helped me connect real-life incidents to cybersecurity concepts.
At this stage, I am building a foundational understanding of:
Cybersecurity principles and terminology
Digital hygiene and safe online practices
Threat awareness and basic risk assessment
How attackers exploit human behavior rather than just systems
I am intentionally starting with awareness and theory before moving into advanced tools by:
Studying beginner cybersecurity resources
Researching common cyber attack patterns
Documenting my learning progress
Preparing for hands-on labs and practical exercises
As I progress, I plan to focus on:
Practical cybersecurity labs
Entry-level security tools and environments
Networking fundamentals
Introductory cybersecurity certifications
This document represents the beginning of my cybersecurity learning journey. My goal is to develop the skills needed to protect digital systems and help others avoid the kind of experience that led me into this field.
